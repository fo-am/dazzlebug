# Dazzlebug

[Dazzlebug](http://www.dazzle-bug.co.uk/) is an open source citizen science game made with [Laura Kelley](https://laurakelleyresearch.wordpress.com/) 
and [Anna Hughes](https://scienceanna.wordpress.com/) at Cambridge University to see what 
patterns are most effective at evading capture from predators. We can then use these results to look at what visual effects 
these patterns have, and to see whether these patterns match up with those found on real animals in the wild.

The game uses an advanced development of the genetic pattern evolution system used for the [egglab game](https://fo.am/activities/egglab/), with more geometric patterns added to the mix. The findings will offer insight into the role of stripes, which are common in many species. While these patterns may have evolved to confuse the visual perception of a predator, they may also be a result of other selection pressures, such as attracting a mate or regulating body temperature. If striped patterns survive and evolve in the game, this would provide strong evidence that these patterns do act to confuse human predators and therefore likely to do the same for other creatures.

Dazzlebug has since been used for teaching by the University of Glasgow in a laboratory practical session, and a special 
version has been exhibited at the [Eden Project Invisible Worlds exhibition](https://www.edenproject.com/visit/whats-here/invisible-worlds-exhibition) during 2018 and 2019 and at the [Anchorage Museum](https://www.anchoragemuseum.org/) in Alaska as part of their [Camouflage: In Plain Sight Exhibition](https://www.anchoragemuseum.org/exhibits/camouflage-in-plain-sight) in 2017.

## Setup and installing

Requires [RacketLang](https://racket-lang.org/).

To run:

    racket dazzle-server.scm 8000

There 8000 is the port name, the IP address can be configured in the dazzle-server script.
